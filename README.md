# Moving Platform Tutorial
 
This is how you can make a moving platform for your game.

 ## 1. Add a Cube Object, Edit it, and then name it `Platform`.

 Once you done it you will end up with this.

Make sure you add more cubes within it so that the player does not fall of when using the platform.

## 2. Create an animation for the platform to move left and right.

Once you've done that you will be left with a moving platform.
