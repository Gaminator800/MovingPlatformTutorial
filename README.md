# Moving Platform Tutorial
 
In this tutorial, we are going to show you how you can make a moving platform for your game.

 ## 1. Add a Cube Object, Edit it, and then name it `Platform`.

Right click then go on 3D Object and click on Cube.

Make sure you add more cubes within it to create walls to prevent the player from falling off when using the platform.

## 2. Create an animation for the platform to move left and right.

First, click Create Animator and then animate the platform left and right.

Make sure you make the animation longer for the player to get on the platform when it comes to timing.

Once you've done that you will be left with a moving platform.
